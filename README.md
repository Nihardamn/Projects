# Projects
This project involves building a system that can recognize and classify hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It captures hand movements through a webcam or image input, processes the images to detect hand regions, extracts key features (such as hand landmarks or contours), and uses a trained model to identify specific gestures.
